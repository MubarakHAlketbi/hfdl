# Active Context: HFDL - Hugging Face Download Library

## What We're Working On Now
We've successfully implemented fixes for all the critical issues identified in the HFDL project based on the detailed analysis report. The enhanced download mode now properly enforces bandwidth limits, accurately reports download status, and uses concurrent processing for small files. We've also improved file discovery performance and addressed speed measurement edge cases.

## Recent Changes
1. **Speed Control Implementation**: Added a new `_speed_controlled_download` function that properly enforces bandwidth limits using a throttling mechanism
2. **Success Tracking**: Implemented proper tracking of failed downloads in enhanced mode to accurately report download status
3. **Concurrent Small File Downloads**: Optimized small file downloads to use the thread pool for concurrent processing
4. **File Discovery Optimization**: Improved file discovery performance by using `list_repo_tree` instead of making multiple API calls for metadata
5. **Speed Measurement Improvements**: Added size checks and adaptive measurement duration to handle small sample files

## Next Steps
1. Add comprehensive tests for the new speed-controlled download function
2. Update documentation to reflect the changes and new features
3. Consider adding a progress bar for the overall download process
4. Implement more robust error recovery mechanisms

## Current Issues
1. ~~Unused Speed Allocation~~ (FIXED)
2. ~~Improper Success Checking~~ (FIXED)
3. ~~Sequential Small File Downloads~~ (FIXED)
4. ~~File Discovery Performance~~ (FIXED)
5. ~~Speed Measurement Edge Case~~ (FIXED)

All identified issues have been successfully addressed. The next phase will focus on adding tests and improving documentation.
