# Progress: HFDL - Hugging Face Download Library

## What Works
- Initial Memory Bank setup completed
- Project structure and code organization analyzed
- Core functionality of the library understood:
  - Dual download modes (standard and enhanced)
  - Thread management based on CPU availability
  - File categorization by size
  - Comprehensive error handling in legacy mode
- Issues identified from detailed analysis report
- Implemented fixes for all identified issues:
  1. Added speed-controlled download function that properly enforces bandwidth limits
  2. Fixed success reporting in enhanced mode to accurately track failed downloads
  3. Optimized small file downloads to use concurrent processing via thread pool
  4. Improved file discovery performance by using `list_repo_tree` instead of multiple API calls
  5. Addressed speed measurement edge cases with small sample files by adding size checks and adaptive measurement duration

## What Didn't Work
- **Speed Allocation Implementation**: The original speed allocation feature calculated thread speeds but didn't actually enforce them during download
- **Success Status Reporting**: Enhanced mode reported success even when some files failed to download
- **Small File Download Approach**: Sequential downloading of small files was inefficient for repositories with many small files
- **File Discovery Performance**: Multiple API calls for metadata were inefficient
- **Speed Measurement Edge Case**: Small sample files could lead to inaccurate speed estimates

## What's Left to Build
1. Add comprehensive tests for the new speed-controlled download function
2. Update documentation to reflect the changes and new features
3. Consider adding a progress bar for the overall download process
4. Implement more robust error recovery mechanisms
